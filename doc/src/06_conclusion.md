# Conclusion

Our variational Monte Carlo solver was successfully implemented and finds the desired variational parameter $\alpha$ per the specified bosonic system, which is in accordance with the analytical solution. Even though the solver provides correct results by utilizing importance sampling in our Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, we experience inconsistencies, slowdowns and errors with this method that were not expected. This is emphasized as a topic of improvement for further reports.
