# Introduction

The ground state energy of different amounts of trapped, hard spheres Bose gas atoms are evaluated using Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) numerical calculations. The use of this, and other, numerical methods have been and will continue to be important in order to be able to preform such experiments/simulations, witch would not be possible otherwise(??)
