\begin{abstract}
We use Rust to develop a ground state solver for bosonic systems in an elliptical harmonic trap, utilizing the variational principle, Monte Carlo integration and two different implementations of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The results are compared against each other and analytical solutions for the corresponding systems. The solver gives the desired results, but shows instability for the importance sampling Metropolis algorithm.
