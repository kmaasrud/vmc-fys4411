## Importance sampling
With importance sampling, the walk in the coordinate space will be biased by the trail wave function.(hvis jeg bare forsto hva jeg skreiv n√•..) We will base our approach on the Fokker-Planck and Langevin equations, which is used for trajectory generation in the coordinate space. (Er dette for mye kopiert fra [Importance Sampling](http://compphysics.github.io/ComputationalPhysics2/doc/pub/week3/html/week3.html)?)

For one particle (sometimes also called walker), the **one-dimensional** Fokker-Planck equation for a diffusion process is:
$$
\frac{\partial P}{\partial t}=D \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}-F\right) P(x, t)
$$
Where $P(x,t)$ is is a time-dependent probability density, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient and $F$ is a drift term.

From here, the Langevin equation is solved using Euler's method, which will give us the new positions in coordinate space.
$$
\frac{\partial x(t)}{\partial t}=D F(x(t))+\eta
$$
Where $\eta$ is a random variable. This gives the new position:
$$
y=x+D F(x) \Delta t+\xi \sqrt{\Delta t}
$$
Where the letters and symbols mean:
|Variable|Description|
|---|---|
|y | new position|
|x |old position
|DF(x) | Diffusion and Drift at the old possition|
|$\Delta$t | Chosen time-step|
|$\xi$ | Gaussian random variable |
Examples of timesteps giving stable values of the ground state energy is $\Delta t \in[0.001,0.01]$
