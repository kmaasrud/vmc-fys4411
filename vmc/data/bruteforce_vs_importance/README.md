The data in this directory is produced by a Lenovo Yoga S730 with an Intel i7-8465U processor and 16GB of memory.

The following values are set for the simulation:

- **Number of Monte Carlo cycles**: 100 000
- **Number of particles**: 10
- **Spherical or elliptical**: Spherical
- **Dimensions**: Produce for all

We vary the value of alpha from ~0.05 to 1. In addition, we do this for different step sizes depending on the number of cores available. This run used 8 cores.
